Welcome. This repository contains materials for [MOSI](mosi.org)'s 2015 Home School Computer Science Class. All documents required for this course will posted here for convenient access in the computer lab and at home. Below is a desciption of the class.
>Let's take a different approach towards high school math education with a focus on introductory computer programming. Programming is the process of instructing computers to carry out certain tasks - any games, software, application, etc. on a computer was created by a human through programming. Students will learn the basics of the Java programming language and computational thinking, through project-based learning in class and practice study at home. 

###Processing - What is it? and how to download.
This class will be using [Processing](processing.org) to complete all homework assignments and in-class projects. Processing is a very user friendly tool for learning how to code and has a large amount of resources for learning online. to see example projects, go to [this](https://processing.org/examples/) page and click some of the links.

To Download, click [here](https://processing.org/download/) to pull up processing's website. Processing is available for free, but also accepts donations if you are inclined to do so. Select a donation amount (custom amount or no donation) and then click "Download" below. On the next page, choose your operating system and the download will begin.
